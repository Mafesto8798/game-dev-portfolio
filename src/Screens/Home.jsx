          description="The biggest challenges I've faced during this game's development was implementing a singleton pattern to 
          have an object to store the player's progress and unlocking levels as you finished, as well as working more closely with Unity UI to make
          the experience more immersive. I really enjoyed creating the different enemies despite my drawing skills, and felt that making the camera shake, having the background move infinitely, 
          and having particles go all over the screen really makes it more of a seamless experience.

          I've played on itch.io and wanted to do something similar but with a twist. I love the art of bonsai and have recently started diving into it and thought it would be a perfect chance
          to implemet that theme with a game to grow plants. My first thought was to grow plants with a watering timer making them more valuable, and selling them to make a profit and to be able to
           purchase more exciting plants.  "
